@article{mak2006indel,
	Abstract = {We are interested in detecting homologous genomic DNA sequences with the goal of locating approximate inverted, interspersed, and tandem repeats. Standard search techniques start by detecting small matching parts, called seeds, between a query sequence and database sequences. Contiguous seed models have existed for many years. Recently, spaced seeds were shown to be more sensitive than contiguous seeds without increasing the random hit rate. To determine the superiority of one seed model over another, a model of homologous sequence alignment must be chosen. Previous studies evaluating spaced and contiguous seeds have assumed that matches and mismatches occur within these alignments, but not insertions and deletions (indels). This is perhaps appropriate when searching for protein coding sequences (<5% of the human genome), but is inappropriate when looking for repeats in the majority of genomic sequence where indels are common. In this paper, we assume a model of homologous sequence alignment which includes indels and we describe a new seed model, called indel seeds, which explicitly allows indels. We present a waiting time formula for computing the sensitivity of an indel seed and show that indel seeds significantly outperform contiguous and spaced seeds when homologies include indels. We discuss the practical aspect of using indel seeds and finally we present results from a search for inverted repeats in the dog genome using both indel and spaced seeds.Contact: dyfmak@bu.edu},

	Abstract = {The novel introduction of spaced seed idea in the filtration stage of sequence comparison by Ma et al. (Bioinformatics 18 (2002) 440) has greatly increased the sensitivity of homology search without compromising the speed of search. Finding the optimal spaced seeds is of great importance both theoretically and in designing better search tool for sequence comparison. In this paper, we study the computational aspects of calculating the hitting probability of spaced seeds; and based on these results, we propose an efficient algorithm for identifying optimal spaced seeds. },

@article{Keich2004253,
	Abstract = {Genomics studies routinely depend on similarity searches based on the strategy of finding short seed matches (contiguous k bases) which are then extended. The particular choice of the seed length, k, is determined by the tradeoff between search speed (larger k reduces chance hits) and sensitivity (smaller k finds weaker similarities). A novel idea of using a single deterministic optimized spaced seed was introduced in Ma et al. (Bioinformatics (2002) 18) to the above similarity search process and it was empirically demonstrated that the optimal spaced seed quadruples the search speed, without sacrificing sensitivity. Multiple, randomly spaced patterns, spaced q-grams, and spaced probes were also studied in Califano and Rigoutsos (Technical Report, \{IBM\} T.J. Watson Research Center (1995), Burkhardt, K{\"a}rkk{\"a}inen, \{CPM\} (2001), and Buhler, Bioinformatics 17 (2001) 419) and in other applications [(RECOMB (1999) 295, \{RECOMB\} (2000) 245)]. They were all found to be better than their contiguous counterparts. In this paper we study some of the theoretical and practical aspects of optimal seeds. In particular we demonstrate that the commonly used contiguous seed is in some sense the worst one, and we offer an algorithmic solution to the problem of finding the optimal seed. },

@article{farachcolton2007optimal,
	Abstract = {Filtering is a standard technique for fast approximate string matching in practice. In filtering, a quick first step is used to rule out almost all positions of a text as possible starting positions for a pattern. Typically this step consists of finding the exact matches of small parts of the pattern. In the followup step, a slow method is used to verify or eliminate each remaining position. The running time of such a method depends largely on the quality of the filtering step, as measured by its false positives rate. The quality of such a method depends on the number of true matches that it misses, that is, on its false negative rate. A spaced seed is a recently introduced type of filter pattern that allows gaps (i.e. do not cares) in the small sub-pattern to be searched for. Spaced seeds promise to yield a much lower false positives rate, and thus have been extensively studied, though heretofore only heuristically or statistically. In this paper, we show how to design almost optimal spaced seeds that yield no false negatives. },

@article{kazazian2004mobile,
	Abstract = {Mobile elements within genomes have driven genome evolution in diverse ways. Particularly in plants and mammals, retrotransposons have accumulated to constitute a large fraction of the genome and have shaped both genes and the entire genome. Although the host can often control their numbers, massive expansions of retrotransposons have been tolerated during evolution. Now mobile elements are becoming useful tools for learning more about genome evolution and gene function.},

Why detect repetitive DNA?
Repetitive DNA are generally not found to have any function
Homology searches need repeat mashing to avoid explosion of unnecessary results
Repeats contain info about parentage},

@article{cohen2004bioinformatics,
	Abstract = {{The article aims to introduce computer scientists to the new field of
   bioinformatics. This area has arisen from the needs of biologists to
   utilize and help interpret the vast amounts of data that are constantly
   being gathered in genomic research-and its more recent counterparts,
   proteomics and functional genomics. The ultimate goal of bioinformatics
   is to develop in silico models that will complement in vitro and in vivo
   biological experiments. The article provides a bird's eye view of the
   basic concepts in molecular cell biology, outlines the nature of the
   existing data, and describes the kind of computer algorithms and
   techniques that are necessary to understand cell behavior. The
   underlying motivation for many of the bioinformatics approaches is the
   evolution of organisms and the complexity of working with incomplete and
   noisy data. The topics covered include: descriptions of the current
   software especially developed for biologists, computer and mathematical
   cell models, and areas of computer science that play an important role
   in bioinformatics.}},
