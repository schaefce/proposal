\section{Graduate Assistantship}
My strong mathematical background gave me an advantage when I took theory-based computer science courses. For this reason, I was asked to be the teaching assistant for the Algorithms course professor during my second semester as a graduate student. I was in charge of grading problem sets, as well as holding office hours to provide additional help for students. Due to positive reviews from the professor I was assisting, the Department Head asked me to be the teaching assistant for Computer Architecture. Additionally, I was asked to tutor an undergraduate student in the introductory Software Engineering course.

Upon the suggestion of my research advisor, I applied for and received a Graduate Assistantship for the 2014-2015 academic year. This award covers my tuition and gives me a living stipend in exchange for my work as a teaching assistant for a professor. This semester, I am the teaching assistant for Algorithms, Data Structures, and Operating Systems.

As a teaching assistant, I have experience grading papers, problem sets, and proofs, as well as holding office hours to provide additional help for undergraduate and graduate students in various courses.
