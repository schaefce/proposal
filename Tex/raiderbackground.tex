\section{RAIDER}

This proposal seeks to improve an already existing repeat finding tool, known as Rapid Ab Initio Detection of Elementary repeats (RAIDER) \cite{figueroa2013raider}. RAIDER is a linear time repeat-finding tool that employs the use of Lmers, hashing, and spaced seeds. The results it gives have been compared to those of RepeatScout, a widely used repeat finding tool, and from this comparison it seems that the tools display similar sensitivity and specificity when detecting repeats. However, RAIDER currently only allows for a single spaced seed to be used in repeat detection, and this seed is chosen arbitarily \cite{figueroa2013raiderpaper}. The sensitivity of RAIDER to the detection of approximate repeats could be improved through a more in-depth study of spaced seeds and approximate repeats.
