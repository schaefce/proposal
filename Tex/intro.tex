\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Repetitive DNA makes up a significant portion of most genomes, especially those of eukaryotic organisms. Repetitive DNA accounts for over one-third of the genetic material of higher organisms \cite{britten1968repeated}. In fact, the Human Genome Project revealed that over one half of the DNA in the human genome is composed of these repetitive sequences \cite{lander2001initial}.
