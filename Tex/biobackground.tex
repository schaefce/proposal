\section{Biological Background}
Every living organism inherits information from its parents that affects the organism's distinguishing traits \cite{lewin2014lewins}. This information is embedded as a sequence inside of an organism's genetic material, a molecule known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). An organism's \textit{genome} is the set of all DNA sequences associated with that organism.

Each sequence of DNA is composed of a chain of nucleotides. There are four nucleotides found in DNA: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T)  \cite{elloumi2011algorithms}. DNA can therefore be represented as a finite string $s=s_{0}s_{1}...s_{n-1}$ over the alphabet $\Sigma=\lbrace A, C, G, T\rbrace$ of nucleotides.

\textit{Repetitive DNA} is defined as a set of discrete DNA sequences in the same genome that are similar or identical to one another \cite{treangen2012repetitive}. It makes up a significant portion of most genomes, accounting for over one-third of the genetic material of higher organisms \cite{britten1968repeated}. In fact, the Human Genome Project revealed that over one half of the DNA in the human genome is composed of these repetitive sequences \cite{lander2001initial}. We will go on to define these repetitive sequences (repeats) more concretely.
