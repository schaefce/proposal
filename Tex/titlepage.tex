\begin{abstract}
Identifying repetitive sequences within a genome is one of the fundamental problems in bioinformatics. Repetitive DNA is a significant portion of most genomes, especially eukaryotic genomes \cite{pevzner2004de-novo}. This proposal seeks to improve an already existing repeat finding tool, known as Rapid Ab Initio Detection of Elementary repeats (RAIDER) \cite{figueroa2013raiderpaper}.
