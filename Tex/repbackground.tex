\subsection{Survey of Repeat Finding Tools}
Over the years following the discovery of the abundance of repetitive DNA, a variety of repeat finding algorithmic approaches and tools have been developed. Repeat finding tools can be broken down into two main categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textit{Library-based} tools compare input genomic data to an existing library of repeat sequences in order to identify known repeats.}
\item{\textit{Ab initio} tools attempt to identify repeats without using any pre-existing knowledge of known repeat sequences or motifs.}
\end{enumerate}
