Task & Finish (End of listed month) \\ \hline 
Research methods of spaced seed design and analysis in order to better understand how to approach optimizing spaced seeds for repeat-finding. & 10/14 \\ \hline

Determine how to best use spaced seeds in RAIDER and potentially make some changes to the algorithm to make it more amenable to spaced seed usage. & 12/14 \\ \hline

Work on optimizing spaced seeds for use in RAIDER. & 01/14 \\ \hline

Have one or several hypothesized optimal spaced seeds for RAIDER. Analyze the different results retrieved using these seeds. & 02/14 \\ \hline

Either continue trying to optimize individual spaced seeds or start working on ways to best use multiple spaced seeds. & 04.5/14 \\ \hline

Prepare results for final presentation. & 05.5/14 \\
